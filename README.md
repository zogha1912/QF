This project is an initiation into the concept of business-oriented AI agents based on LLMs.
It is a proof of concept for building a multi-agent system composed of three main agents:

**Knowledge Management Agent**

**Office Management Agent**

**Recruitment Agent**

These agents are designed to assist collaborators and employees in their daily tasks.

You can find the source code in this repository.
To run the project successfully and enable LLM calling functions, you need to create a **.env** file and specify your LLM API key inside it.
